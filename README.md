## Using the template registry

Coming soon.

## Registry structure

The repo is structured as follows:

- `stages` - Contains all templates for stages
- `jobs` - Contains all templates for jobs
- `steps` - Contains all templates for steps

Every folder can have sub-folders to provide more structure, for example `steps/helm/` that provides all steps related to Helm.
